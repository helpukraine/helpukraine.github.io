                            <h3> Is Putin the sole responsible for this war? </h3>

                            Indeed, some politicians, in particular Germany's Scholz, and journalists often claim that Putin is the only responsible for this war. However, the following suggests that this claim  is not justified:

                                A <a href="https://www.interfax.ru/russia/827641" target="_blank">survey</a> by VTsIOM showed that Putin's rating jumped ten percent in the week ending March 11 to reach 77% as compared to 67% on the week ending February 14 (before the war). This is in line with the raise of Putin's support among Russians after the Crimea annexation in 2014.
